## Project Information

AIT 526
Final Project
Author: Team 1 - Alice Chen, Hrishikesh Karambelkar, Prakriti Panday, Sean Park


## Description of the problem to be solved 

The objective of this project attempts to simplify medical diagnosis, interpret the content, provide a score reflecting the severity of the diagnosis and define complex terms typically used in medical jargon. The main system entails a chatbot with multiple components integrated into it's script including a API connection to a medical library and a sentiment analyzer. Both these systems reflect the two main services offered by the chatbot, medical term definitions and diagnosis interpretation. The medical term utlizes an API key to connect to UMLS, a medical library. This connection extracts definitions that chatbot user may be interested in. The next component includes scoring the sentiment of the diagnosis using the Vader librar, which the user can comprehend either as a severe or non-severe diagnosis.
